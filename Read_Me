Under the resources folder, you can name the folder as either static or public.

Unlike putting your html files under WEB-INF, which provides protections for html or jsp file, 
html resources under the static or public folder can be get accessed to by get request, so you'd better 
add an interceptor.

Supoose you are creating folder called static under the resources folder, you can put css, 
js and something like that under the static folder.
